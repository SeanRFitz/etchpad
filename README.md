I created a drawing app. Whenever the user puts his/her mouse over a square, then the square will change colors.

I learned
	- How to use javascript/jquery
	- How to prompt a user for input
	- Create divs using jquery
	- Modify css using jquery
	- toggleClass/addClass using jquery
	- lots of other jquery
	- How to write functions and return values
	- pass parameters into functions

What I need to practice
	- Functions because I was confused as to whether they should be inside of the $(document).ready(...)
	- Code syntax/order
